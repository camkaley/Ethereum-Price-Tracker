# Ethereum-Price-Tracker
A simple python script using an API from coinbase (https://api.coinbase.com/v2/exchange-rates). Simply gets the price of 1 ETH in and converts it to its price in AUD, showing how much it has changed in price since the last time the program was run and the profit determined by what is set in the program settings.
